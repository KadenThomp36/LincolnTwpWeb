    There was discussion on how this site would compare to the substation on 
    Eastman Road next to Eastman Party Store. This unit is approximately ½ the 
    size of that one. When the cooling fans on these units run the noise level 
    goes up 2 to 3 DB, the higher number stated before is with the fans running. 
    When you take a noise level reading 1 foot from the face of the unit it will 
    be approximately 65 DB, the above levels noted are at the property line.</p>

    It was reviewed by Consumers Energy what the purpose of this substation is. 
    It is to help take care of the overload situation at the existing Sanford 
    Substation. There will be two main feeds going out of the new substation on 
    Price Road, one going west and one going east to help improve the 
    dependability of the system.</p>

    Calkins by Sheila Mesler if he heard any noise while at that residence. Mr. 
    Calking said no he did not hear any noise and indicated that the residence 
    owner said he mainly heard the noise when the cooling fans were running. It

    Steve Grabowski – Lives to the north of the proposed substation. Steve is an 
    electrical engineer and an amateur radio operator. With the lines coming 
    down into the proposed sub station he will be virtually boxed in with the 
    radio noise from the power lines. He originally had to reconfigure his 
    antennas for the existing power lines to reduce the noise and now it will or 
    may be difficult to not get noise on his radio, the higher the voltage the 
    more noise you get.</p>

    Larry Moe – We went through this discussion 2 weeks ago and why can’t 
    Consumers move to somewhere else. Steve Markey presented a drawing he had 
    gotten from public document on file in the county for the original plat of 
    the Lincoln Estates Subdivision and it showed the property that Consumers 
    owns as being there and noted as “Exception”. He also presented a copy that 
    showed that at the time it was purchase it is listed in public documents 
    that it was proposed to be a sub station. This information has been on file

    Connie Moe – Did Consumers check the possibility of moving the substation to 
    the north of the express way? They feel this would be a better site for it. 
    Steve Markey indicated again that the current site they are requesting is 
    the best site for what they need to do. Kevin Keane from Consumers responded 
    also to this question. Consumers is regulated by the State Public Service 
    Commission and Consumers is mandated to provide affordable rates for 
    everyone. Their rates are approved by the PSC and to move to another site 
    would cost more not only from more equipment and lines needed but additional 
    property that would need to be purchase. The current site is already owned 
    by Consumers and is still the best site available.</p>
