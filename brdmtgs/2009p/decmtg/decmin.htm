	<p class="style1">A public hearing was held upon a request from Hidden 
	Trails Campground LLC for a Special Use permit to allow a campground to be 
	operated on vacant property that is currently zoned Residential. Petitioner 
	Jamie Kaufman spoke in support of the request in preparations of a future 
	development of this 80 acre parcel on Stark Rd (Tax # 
	56-110-023-100-010-00). His plans are to develop the easterly 600 feet along 
	Stark Rd as residential homes. He is proposing a multiple site campgrounds 
	in the center of the subject parcel with no more than 100 sites. The 
	proposed sites will be 3,600 to 3,800 square feet in size. (Typical camp 
	sites are only 1,200 sq. ft.) The area on the west end of the parcel is to 
	be used for recreation and a pond. A septic tank system and drain field will 
	be used for camping only. This system is not designed for cold weather use 
	and must be shut down for winter. The camp ground is proposed to be open 
	from April to October.</p>
	<p class="style1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="style1">Public Comments - 18 citizens were in attendances for the 
	public hearing (including petitioner):</p>
	<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Bob Sheets of 3077 N Stark Rd stated that a Special 
		Use permit is a way around rezoning and not a good idea for this 
		application. He is also concerned with illegal cutting of trees and 
		trespassing. Mr. Sheets also has concerns about access of fire equipment 
		and fire safety. He opposes the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Bob Marks, Lincoln Township Fire Chief asked questions 
		about water service, fire hydrants and the depth of the proposed 
		swimming pond. The petitioner responded that the main hydrants will stay 
		active all the time and the camping services will have separate 
		shut-offs for the winter. The pond will be at least twelve feet deep to 
		avoid becoming stagnant. </p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Diana Richardson lives near the subject property and 
		is concerned about noise and trespassing. She also wanted to know what 
		would stop them from becoming a year-round campground. The petition 
		responded that he would accept conditions to limit the months the 
		campground could be used. Ms. Richardson opposes the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Gerald Nightlinger of 1177 E Beamish Rd said that the 
		zoning ordinance was adopted to protect property owner rights and over 
		the years it has been amended for necessary changes. He is concerned 
		with the potential for problems from alcohol, parties, and trespassing. 
		Mr. Nightlinger opposes the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Tim Chisholm of 3191 N Start Rd is concerned about the 
		effects this campground would have on the wildlife and the hunters in 
		the area due to additional noise. Mr. Chisholm opposes the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Hugh Nightlinger of 1285 E Beamish Rd asked if the 
		property would be gated or will have a guard on duty. The petition 
		responded that there would be someone on site to take care of problems 
		that arise. Hugh says the campground does not belong there and opposes 
		the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Kathleen Kemp of 1800 N Stark Rd is concerned that if 
		the campground is controlled by the State of Michigan, will the Township 
		have the authority to control noise and other problems. Kathleen opposes 
		the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Larry Hunt of 1119 E Beamish Rd asked to explain 
		Special Use. Sue Ensign responded; the request is for the right to use 
		the property for some other use than what it is zoned for and if the 
		campground would fail the property would revert back to its original 
		use. Mr. Hunt says the campground does not fit, it will increase traffic 
		and he opposes the request.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">
		<p class="style1">Ron Thompson of 1310 E Beamish Rd said he enjoys the 
		quiet rural setting and wildlife in the area. The proposed campground 
		would create noise and additional traffic and disrupt the natural 
		setting. Such a use is not consistent with the Master Plan and it is a 
		poor fit for the area. Ron strongly opposes the request.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="style1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="style1">Petitioner response: Mr. Kaufman said that he understands 
	the concerns of the neighboring property owners. He says that the rules are 
	more stringent in a private campground and guests that violate the rules 
	will be asked to leave promptly.</p>
	<p class="style1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="style1">Commission Comments: The commission said they did not 
	believe this is the right use for the area. It is not consistent with the 
	zoning ordinance or current use of surrounding properties, nor is it 
	consistent with the Master Plan and future land use maps. </p>
	<p class="style1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="style1">A motion to accept petitioner’s request for a Special Use 
	Permit, as stated on the application filed by Hidden Trails Campground LLC, 
	was made by Vice Chairperson, Sheila Mesler and supported by Member, Denise 
	Schneider. Motion Denied 5-0. </p>
	<p class="style1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="style1">Old Business: Reviewed and discussed correcting 
	typographical errors and other types of mistakes or omissions within the
