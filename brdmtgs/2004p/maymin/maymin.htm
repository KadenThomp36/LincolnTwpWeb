    <p>The meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning Commission was called to 
    order by Joseph Leigeb, chairperson at 6:33 p.m.</p>
    <p>Roll call was taken: Joseph Leigeb, Denise Schneider and Gary Elza were 
    present. Sheila Mesler and Kevin Wray arrived at 6:55 p.m.</p>
    <p>Motion by Denise Schneider with support by Gary Elza to accept the 
    minutes of the March 2, 2004 meeting as read. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>Motion by Gary Elza with support by Denise Schneider to accept the agenda 
    as presented. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>Cynthia Winland from The Spicer Group reviewed the zoning text revisions 
    and additions that had been contracted for in the original scope of work. 
    These revisions are still just proposed, the commission must continue the 
    review process and get questions if any back to Cynthia.</p>
    <p>Cynthia also presented some additional revisions they feel would 
    supplement the zoning text for the commission to consider. Any questions 
    regarding any of this can be directed back to Cynthia</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The site plan review as submitted by Marietta Sprott was discussed. 
    Motion by Shelia Mesler with support by Kevin Wray to accept the site plan 
    as submitted with the additional requirements. The existing building noted 
    to be used as an office is inspected by the Township Building Inspector for 
    structural integrity, the new driveway must be approved by M-Dot. The 
    cleaning up of the site will continue. Kevin Wray asked to make and 
    amendment to the motion that the infrastructure will be in place before 
    opening for customers, Shelia Mesler agreed. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb requested comments from the commission members and the 
    public. There was a question regarding the approved site plan for Janet 
    Asphalt as nothing has been done as had been requested. It was suggested a 
    letter be sent requesting information on what they are planning on doing. 
    This same issue was raised with the site plan review approved for Gary 
    Briggs, all that appears to have been done is some fill dirt moved in along 
    with some junk equipment. Chairperson Leigeb will write both a letter 
    requesting updates.</p>
    <p>There was no old or new business presented at this time.</p>
    <p>The next meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning Commission is scheduled 
    for June 1, 2004 at 6:30 p.m. in the township hall.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb adjourned the meeting at 8:55 p.m.</p>
