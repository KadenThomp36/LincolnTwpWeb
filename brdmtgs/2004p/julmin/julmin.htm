    <p>The meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning Commission was called to 
    order by Joseph Leigeb, chairperson at 6:30 p.m.</p>
    <p>Roll call was taken: Joseph Leigeb, Denise Schneider, Kevin Wray and Gary 
    Elza were present, Sheila Mesler was absent.</p>
    <p>Motion by Kevin Wray with support by Denise Schneider to accept the 
    minutes of the June 22, 2004 meeting. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>Motion by Kevin Wray with support by Denise Schneider to accept the 
    agenda as presented. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>The site plan review as submitted to the commission by Joseph Leigeb for 
    Matt Rapanos, Mr. Rapano was not present to answer question. Upon review 
    Joseph Leigeb presented the following clarifications from his conversation 
    with Matt Rapanos. The storage area will be used to rent space for boats, 
    campers, trailers, vehicles; this will not be used for items for sale out of 
    this space. Per the drawing submitted the area would be completely fenced 
    with a gate in the middle on Saginaw road. This will require a new driveway 
    from Saginaw road, which will require a permit either from Midland County or 
    the State of Michigan, which ever has precedence. Motion by Gary Elza with 
    support by Denise Schneider to accept the site plan with the additional 
    clarifications as listed above. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>At this time the planning commission started to review the zoning text 
    with Cindy Winland of The Spicer Group. Items in question were resolved and 
    Cindy will make the changes and then send copies to Joseph Leigeb for 
    distribution to the appropriate people for review. Then Joseph Leigeb will 
    schedule a public hearing for review of the changes. Joseph Leigeb will work 
    with Cindy to schedule her for the next appropriate meeting for her to 
    attend regarding the zoning text revisions.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb went to the open discussion portion of the meeting, 
    there was nothing presented from the commission or the public at this time.</p>
    <p>There was no old business presented to the commission at this time.</p>
    <p>Under new business the Lincoln Township Junkyard ordinance #1 was 
    discussed. Motion by Kevin Wray with support by Gary Elza to add the 
    following wording: Operable unlicensed vehicles are allowed in commercial 
    storage areas. Motion approved</p>
    <p>The next meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning Commission is scheduled 
    for August 24, 2004 at 6:30 p.m. in the township hall.</p>
