    <p>The meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning Commission was called to 
    order by Joseph Leigeb, chairperson at 6:30 p.m.</p>
    <p>Roll call was taken: Joseph Leigeb, Sheila Mesler, Kevin Wray and Gary 
    Elza were present. Denise Schneider was absent</p>
    <p>Motion by Kevin Wray with support by Gary Elza to accept the minutes of 
    the May 4, 2004 meeting. One correction to be made in the seventh paragraph, 
    Sheila is misspelled. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>Motion by Gary Elza with support by Kevin Wray to accept the agenda as 
    presented. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>The site plan review as submitted for Sanford Med. Center PC was 
    discussed. Motion by Sheila Mesler with support by Gary Elza to accept the 
    site plan as submitted. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>The site plan review as submitted for Hang Time Hoops was discussed. 
    Keith Thurlow and Jerry Schafer answered question regarding the site plan. 
    Motion by Kevin Wray with support by Sheila Mesler to accept the site plan 
    as submitted. Motion approved.</p>
    <p>At this time the planning commission continued review of the zoning text 
    revisions that have been submitted by The Spicer Group. Additional questions 
    will be sent back to them for clarification. At this point the next meeting 
    to work on these changes was set for June 22, 2004 at 6:30 p.m. in the 
    Lincoln Township hall.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb requested comments from the commission members and the 
    public. There were none presented.</p>
    <p>Under old business it was discussed as to the procedure regarding site 
    plan reviews that had been approved but there was no action being taken on 
    them by the applicants. What or who is to take action in regard to these? It 
    was reviewed that the building inspector would be the person to address this 
    as it falls into his jurisdiction. This may need clarification from the 
    township board at a later date.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb requested new business and Gene Frank requested 
    clarification as to what zoning his property at 66 E. Price Rd. was. It was 
    determined that it was in B-2. It was discussed how the 100’ set back 
    applied to B-2 zoning when the adjoining property is R-1 or R-2. It was 
    suggested the Mr. Frank review his property and the possible uses of it and 
    or the possible rezoning that may work better for him, these were options 
    that he needs to investigate.</p>
    <p>No additional business was presented.</p>
    <p>The next meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning commission is scheduled 
    for June 22, 2004 at 6:30 p.m. in the township hall.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb adjourned the meeting at 8:06 p.m.</p>
