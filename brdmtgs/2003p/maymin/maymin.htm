    <p>The meeting of the Lincoln Township Planning Commission was called to 
    order by Joseph Leigeb, chairperson at 7:00 p.m.</p>
    <p>Roll call was taken: Joseph Leigeb, Sheila Mesler, Denise Schneider, 
    Kevin Wray and Gary Elza were present.</p>
    <p>Minutes of the April 1, 2003 meeting were read. Motion by Gary Elza, 
    support by Kevin Wray to approve the minutes as read. Motion carried.</p>
    <p>Motion by Denise Schneider, support by Sheila Mesler to accept the agenda 
    as presented. Motion carried.</p>
    <p>The unapproved minutes of the April 23, 2003 MIDLAND COUNTY PLANNING 
    COMMISSION were reviewed. It was suggested that for future reference that 
    requests be sent to them in a draft form before we hold a public hearing for 
    any possible changes. This would possible help if there were any changes 
    they felt needed to be made. They approved both requests that had been 
    submitted to the MIDLAND COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION.</p>

    </ol>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb discussed the M-30 corridor study status. It was noted 
    that Lincoln township has approved implementation of the study, Jerome 
    township has not approved it, the Village of Sanford was not sure if they 
    did or not. Chairperson Leigeb has requested a copy of the Village of 
    Sanford minutes to confirm that they did approve it. It was discussed that 
    Lincoln Township must follow the study as approved, this discussion was for 
    information only no action taken at this time. Chairperson Leigeb requested 
    that Kevin Wray ask the township board what direction the Planning 
    Commission should take regarding this issue.</p>
    <p>Chairperson Leigeb moved to the open discussion portion of the meeting.</p>
    <p>Sheila Mesler noted that she has attended a meeting where the Open Space 
    Act was discussed and other townships from around the state have not put 
    anything in writing regarding this either. It is something that still needs 
    to be worked on.</p>
    <p>A question from the floor was asked regarding the reference of sending 
    information to the MIDLAND COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION before having a public 
    hearing and it was clarified that only a draft would be sent for their 
    review not the formal request for any action.</p>
    <p>It was asked if the zoning text changes and the McPeak zoning change 
    would be presented to the township board? Chairperson Leigeb indicated he 
    has a packet ready to go to the board and he would attend the meeting if 
    needed to answer any question the board may have.</p>
    <p>Moved to old business and Sheila Mesler presented a proposed draft for 
    Section 308. Animals and Fowl Other than Household Pets. There was some 
    discussion and then tabled till the next meeting so the rest of the 
    commission members could have time to review the draft.</p>
    <p>Under new business Mr. Bailey presented a draft of a new ANTI-BLIGHT 
    ORDINANCE for review. The township already has an ordinance and the 
    commission tabled this issue till the next meeting so they could review and 
    compare the new and existing one.</p>
    <p>Also presented was a Building Condemnation Ordinance for review. Should 
    the township have an ordinance like this? Discussion followed on how to use 
    existing ordinances to accomplish the same thing. The use of Building Codes 
    and Blight Ordinance may be ways to do this. Henry Pnacek will check the 
    building codes and get back with the Planning Commission on this issue.</p>
    <p>Meeting was adjourned at 7:55 p.m.</p>
    <p>Gary Elza, Secretary</p>
