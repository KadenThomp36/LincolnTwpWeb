    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The meeting of the Lincoln 
    Township Planning Commission was called to order by Joseph Leigeb, 
    chairperson at 7:00 p.m.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Roll call was taken: Joseph 
    Leigeb, Sheila Mesler, Denise Schneider, Kevin Wray and Gary Elza were 
    present.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Minutes of the July 1, 2003 
    meeting were read. Motion by Gary Elza support by Denise Schneider to accept 
    the minutes as read. Roll call vote, passed 5-0. A comment from Kevin Wray 
    that both section 308 and 1303 D as read in the minutes were presented to 
    the Township Board and accepted as written.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Motion by Denise Schneider 
    support by Sheila Mesler to accept the agenda with two additions as 
    presented. Approved.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Chairperson Leigeb presented the 
    site plan review to the commission and welcomed Mr. John Baer from Pumford 
    Construction Inc. to answer questions. Mr. Baer was representing the 
    property owner on the proposed use of the subject property for storage 
    units. After discussion and questions no action was taken at this time as 
    Mr. Baer is going to do additional work on the site plan and return at a 
    later date if they decide to move forward.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Chairperson Leigeb moved to the 
    Open Discussion portion of the meeting for Commission members and public 
    input. The question was asked why should someone have to come to a Planning 
    Commission meeting to get information that should be available to the public 
    on an as needed basis. Should the Township ordinance book be on the web 
    site? The long-range plan is yes, but it is not known when that will happen. 
    Current copies of the book need to be made available to the Commission and 
    the public when requested. There is also a proposal in place and being 
    looked at to update the entire ordinance book.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">There was no old business 
    presented.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Under new business there were 
    three items on the agenda.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It was questioned if the Township 
    should have something pertaining to Temporary Carports &amp; Other Type 
    Canopy’s. At this time no action was taken, just discussion as to the need 
    for it.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A sample copy of a Mineral Mining 
    Ordinance was included in the packet for review by the Commission to be 
    talked about more at future meetings.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Janet Asphalt made a request to 
    modify their previous site plan with the following change. Replace the 
    office structure with a 24’ X 40’ double office trailer with skirting; 
    reduce the pole barn building to a 40’ X 40’ structure with a 20’ space 
    between the office and this building. The rest of the site plan will remain 
    the same adhering to all existing ordinance and building codes. Motion by 
    Sheila Mesler support by Denise Schneider to amend the prior site plan for 
    Janet Asphalt to install a 24’ X 40’ double office trailer with skirting, 
    reduce the pole barn to a 40’ X 40’ structure set 20’ from the office 
    structure. The rest of the site plan as approved before will remain the 
    same. Roll call vote approved 5-0.</p>
